### Opening the Custom Type page
By clicking the *Custom Types* item on the left menu (or by directly following [/masks](https://avail-marketing.prismic.io/masks/)), it is possible to enter the Custom Types page on Prismic UI.

At the grid displayed at the center of the page, locate the custom type to be updated and click on it. This should open the page for viewing and editing the custom type.
> You can also open it directly from the URL [/masks/{content-type-name}.json](https://avail-marketing.prismic.io/masks/info.json/)

### Open the JSON editor
Open the JSON editor by selecting the `JSON editor` tab on the right menu, expand it by clicking the expand icon on the top of the tab, locate where to add/modify/delete the lines and do it, reflecting the diffs from the versioned JSON file. Then click the `Save` button on the top-right corner.
