## Select the frame
On Figma, open the page that holds the component to be exported.
Select the frame of the component to be exported, by locating and clicking it on the frame tree on the left menu, or by directly clicking the element on the view.

The share modal should open.

**Make sure the permissions for `Anyone with the link` are set to `can view`.**

Mark the checkbox for `Link to selected frame`, at the bottom-left corner of the modal. If the checkbox is disabled, close the share modal, make sure that the frame to be exported is selected on Figma, and then click the `Share` button again.

Click on `Copy link` button, on the bottom-left corner of the modal.
